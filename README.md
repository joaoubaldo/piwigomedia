This plugins allows media from a Piwigo site to be inserted into WordPress posts and pages.

== Description ==

PiwigoMedia WordPress plugin features integration between Piwigo sites and Wordpress, using the TinyMCE editor.

The main advantages of PiwigoMedia are:

*   Simplicity. Simple to use and configure
*   No duplicated media. Images are linked from Piwigo's site, nothing is imported into WordPress
*   Independency. WordPress and Piwigo don't have to be installed on the same server since PiwigoMedia uses Piwigo's webapi


== Installation ==

1. Unpack PiwigoMedia's zip file inside `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Configure PiwigoMedia. Go to 'Settings/PiwigoMedia' page in WordPress administration.
4. Access PiwigoMedia functionality using Wordpress' wysiwyg editor
